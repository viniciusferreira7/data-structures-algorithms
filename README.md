## 📚 Algorithms

### Array/Two Pointer Techniques
* [🔗 **Binary Search**](src/array/two-pointer/binary-search.ts) - Efficient searching in sorted arrays
* [🔗 **Exponential Search**](src/array/two-pointer/exponential-search.ts) - Finding range then binary search
* [🔗 **Reverse Words in String**](src/array/two-pointer/reverse-words-in-a-string.ts) - String manipulation using two pointers

### Sliding Window
* [🔗 **Maximum Length Substring**](src/array/two-pointer/sliding-window/maximum-length-substring-with-two-occurrences.ts) - Dynamic window optimization

### Hash Map Patterns  
* [🔗 **Two Sum**](src/array/two-pointer/hashmap/two-sum.ts) - Finding pairs that sum to target

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **TypeScript** - Type-safe algorithm implementations
* **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime and test runner
* **Biome** - Code formatting and linting

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test --watch

# Format code
bunx biome format --write

# Lint code
bunx biome lint --write
```
